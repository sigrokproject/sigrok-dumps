Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyser used was a DSLogic sampling at 10MHz.

  0           RST
  1           SWIM


Data
----

* flash_prog/

Using stm8flash with an ST-Link V2 adapter to program an STM8S003F3.


Command line:

   $ stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s003f3 -s flash -w prog.ihx

   (stm8flash is modified both for correctness and to generate the test sequences.
   The updated version can be found at https://github.com/mjagdis/stm8flash.)

** flash_prog/sample1.sr
   A complete flash programming operation. SWIM is enabled and set to high speed mode
   (notice how the pulse width and period decreases after the initial chatter). A read
   of the affected memory region is made, compared to the data to be written and those
   blocks that contain differences are written back. Finally an SRST SWIM command is
   sent to terminate the conversation and reset the target.
