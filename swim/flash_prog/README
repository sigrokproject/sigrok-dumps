This is a capture of an ST-Link V2 programming an STM8 using the SWIM protocol.

The logic analyser used was a DreamSourceLab DSLogic (at 10MHz).

----------

Using stm8flash with an ST-Link V2 adapter to program an STM8S003F3.

Command line:

  $ stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s003f3 -s flash -w prog.ihx

stm8flash is modified both for correctness and to generate the test sequences.
The updated version can be found at https://github.com/mjagdis/stm8flash.

A complete flash programming operation. SWIM is enabled and set to high
speed mode (notice how the pulse width and period decreases after the
initial chatter). A read of the affected memory region is made, compared to
the data to be written and those blocks that contain differences are written
back. Finally an SRST SWIM command is sent to terminate the conversation
and reset the target.
