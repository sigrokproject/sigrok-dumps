This contains dumps of the ADAT Lightpipe protocol
There are high resolution dumps (100M logic analyzer sample rate)
for 44.1kHz and 48kHz audio samplerate
There is a low resolution dump (32M logic analyzer sample rate)
to test if decoding still works there.

All the audio samples in all the dumps contain only silence.
This is irrelevant for testing, because if the ADAT frame
can be decoded correctly that means that the individual bits also
pose no problem.

Logic Analyzer Hardware:
Saleae Logic 16 clone
Target Device: RME Fireface 800
Pin 0 was connected to the ADAT RX Pin of a self
made ADAT receiver breakout board (Terminal part is PLR-T10,
circuit according to datasheet)
I made the dumps with PulseView, not sigrok-cli
using the samplerates indicated in the filenames,
with only Channel 0 active.

Hans
