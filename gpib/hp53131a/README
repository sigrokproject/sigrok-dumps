Capture of traffic with an HP53131A counter using an AR488 (arduino bitbang gpib adapter).

Data captured using generic/LCsoft FX2 board with fx2lafw at 500kHz.

Send *idn? and receive instrument ident string
Send 'read?' and receive a measurement (10MHz frequency)

Note : I'm unsure whether the state of the bus between read command and result is correct. It may indicate an error in the AR488.

Set HP53131A to period measurement and talk-only mode and AR488 to listen-only mode

Note : the regular NRFD/NDAC handshake occurring before and after the LON transfer is related to the AR488 timing out non-existent transfers and may be incorrect.
