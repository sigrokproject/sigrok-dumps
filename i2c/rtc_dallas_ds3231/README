Maxim Integrated DS3231(M) RTC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Details:

 - DS3231M datasheet: https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS3231M.pdf


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

A) The logic analyzer used was Geeetech Mini Board Cypress FX2(LP) eval board
with fx2lafw firmware (at 4MHz):

 Probe          DS3231 pin
 -------------------------
 0              SCL
 1              SDA


ds3231_ex1.sr
----------------------

The file provides reading/writing of time keeping registers as well as
control, control/status and temperature registers of the RTC chip, which
was setup to 24-hours mode:

- Read Control register
- Write Control register - disable alarms
- Read Control/Status register
- Write Control/Status register - clear alarm's flags
- Write Alarm 1 registers - set Alarm 1 at every 1st date
- Write Alarm 2 registers - set Alarm 2 at every minute
- Read date/time
- Read temperature (MSB)


ds3231_ex2.sr
----------------------

The file provides reading/writing of time keeping registers as well as
control/status and temperature registers of the RTC chip, which was setup
to 24-hours mode and after Alarm 2 occured:

- Read Control/Status register
- Write Control/Status register - clear alarm flag
- Read date/time
- Read temperature (MSB)



B) The logic analyzer used was KeeYees USB Logic Analyzer 24 MHz 8CH
with fx2lafw firmware (at 500kHz):

 Probe          DS3231 pin
 -------------------------
 0              SCL
 1              SDA


ds3231_ex3.sr
----------------------

The file provides writing of time keeping registers to Saturday, 05.09.2020, 
17:30:00 h, alarm1 to daily, 06:29:00 h and alarm2 to every Thursday, 09:15 h
Then it reads all registers from 0x00 to 0x12:

- in one I2C read step
- by sequentially writing the register ID an reading the content
- by sequentially reading the content starting from register 0x0 using auto-
  increment


ds3231_ex4.sr
----------------------

Same as ds3231_ex3.sr, but date / time register in AM/PM mode.


ds3231_ex5.sr
----------------------

Write same data as in ds3231_ex3.sr, then read 30 registers in one I2Cread  
with auto-increment (auto wrap-around after 0x12)
