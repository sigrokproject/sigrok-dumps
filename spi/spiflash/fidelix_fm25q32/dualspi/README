FIDELIX FM25Q32
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a set of example captures of a FIDELIX FM25Q32 SPI flash chip
(32MBit == 4Mbyte) that is read by ESP32.

The first part is the 2nd-stage bootloader loaded from SPI flash (using
QuadSPI @ 10MHz). Then the 2nd-stage bootloader writes 02_blink to SPI flash.

The SPI hardware used is ESP32 DevKitC (from ESPRESSIF).

Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a DreamSourceLab DSLogic (at 100MHz):
