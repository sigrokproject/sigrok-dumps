# TPM transactions over SPI

This is an example capture of TPM 2.0 transactions over SPI.

The logic analyzer used to capture this signal was a DSLogic Pro.

## Logic analyzer setup

The logic analyzer used was a DSLogic Pro (at 250MHz):

  Probe       SPI connector
  -------------------------------------
  
  1 (black) ->   CLK
  
  2 (brown) ->  CS
  
  3 (red)   ->    MOSI
  
  4 (orange) ->  MISO


## Capture (tpm_spi.sr)

PulseView GUI was used to perform the capture.
Here is the detail of the configuration:

### SPI decoder configuration

CS#: CS (Probe 2)

MOSI: MOSI (Probe 3)

CLK: CLK (Probe 1)

MISO: MISO (Probe 4)


CS# Polarity: Active low 

Clock polarity: 0

Clock phase: 0

Bit order: msb-first

Word size: 8

### SPI TPM stack decoder configuration

Stack Decoder: SPI TPM

TPM Wait transfer Mask: 0x00

## Output 

TPM transactions are shown on the `TPM transactions` label.

If the BitLocker Volume Master Key (VMK) is found, it should show it through the `BitLocker Volume Master Key` label.
