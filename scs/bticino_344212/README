SCS (Sistema Cablaggio Semplificato): BTicino 344212 intercom
-------------------------------------------------------------

These measurements have been taken with a Rigol DS1102E oscilloscope.

The target device probed was a BTicino 344212 intercom system.

Channel 1 was set to 10X and connected to the intercom’s SCS bus.

The Sample Rate was set to 10 MHz because:

1. Acquire → Memdepth was set to Long mem.
2. Time Base was set to 2ms.

The captures were transferred from the oscilloscope and converted to sigrok
