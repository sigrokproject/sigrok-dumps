Motor PWM one phase signal (high and low)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a synthetic motor pwm signal (three-phase inverter) for one motor phase 
containing high and low side signals. 
It is very important to satisfy a minimum required dead-time between the two 
signals, so this can be measured with the EdgeDiff decoder.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Salae Logic16 clone.


Decoder setup
-------------

Example decoder setup is contained in the also provided motor_pwm.pvs file.
