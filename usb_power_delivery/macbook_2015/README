Logic analyzer setup

A 'Twinkie' USB type-C interposer was used to capture the communication
on the CCx pins:

  Probe      Signal
  -----------------
  CC1        Control Channel 1
  CC2        Control Channel 2

The type-C connectors are reversible, so the actual communication might
happen on CC1 or CC2 depending the polarity of the plug inside the receptacle.
