3-phase motor pwm signals (high and low side, active low)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a synthetic motor pwm signal (three-phase inverter) containing high and 
low side signals, which are active low (switch is active at low level).
phase U: constantly 10% duty cycle, 
phase V: constantly 50% duty cycle, 
phase W: constantly 90% duty cycle

It is very important to satisfy a minimum required dead-time between switching 
off the high side and switching on the low side and vice-versa to prevent phase
short-circuits. This dead-time can be observed here to be ~1.4us.


Logic analyzer setup
--------------------

The logic analyzer used was a Salae Logic16 clone operated at 16MHz.
